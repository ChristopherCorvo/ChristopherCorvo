### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Christopher Corvo, and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer, Actor, and Podcaster based in New York City. I have a passion for technology, learning about new ideas, and entrepreneurship.

I recently attended Lambda School, an Immersive six-month Full Stack Web Development program that provides a hands-on curriculum in HTML, CSS, Responsive Design, JavaScript, Node, Java, React, Python, Redux, and SQL.

Lambda revealed to me a glimpse of how deep the tech waters are, and I look forward to wading in those waters with all of you. Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-corvo/) with any questions, thoughts, or ideas. Happy coding.
